In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).  Specifically, using `__weak` variables incorrectly can lead to unexpected behavior, particularly when combined with retain cycles or short-lived objects.  For instance, if a `__weak` variable references an object that's deallocated before the `__weak` variable is accessed, the variable will become nil. However, relying on this nil check might not always be sufficient or robust, especially in asynchronous operations where the object's lifetime is unpredictable.
