This repository demonstrates a common issue in Objective-C development related to the usage of `__weak` variables within asynchronous operations under Automatic Reference Counting (ARC). The `weakVarBug.m` file showcases a scenario where an unexpected nil value arises from a `__weak` variable referencing an object that gets deallocated prematurely, causing crashes or undefined behavior. The `weakVarSolution.m` file presents a robust solution to handle such situations, focusing on improving the reliability and robustness of the code by implementing proper checks and handling of the potential nil value.
